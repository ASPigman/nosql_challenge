# NoSQL challenge
A challenge to practice using non-relational databases with NoSQL using MongoDB and PyMongo. In this challenge, I am contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.


## Process
A starter notebook was provided which included basic imports. Further blocks provided guiding comments about what next steps need to be performed. I accessed numerous resources while going through the blocks. These resources included screenshots taken during lectures and demonstrations, solved activity files, and PyMongo documentation surrounding different PyMongo functions.


There are two steps to this challenge, one to set up the database and collections and the other to analyze the data within. The set up includes adding a document, deleting documents, changing data types from strings to numbers, and verifying those changes were made. The analysis includes using counting functions as well as filtering, sorting, and limiting results of various queries.
