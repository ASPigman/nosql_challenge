# NoSQL challenge
A challenge to practice using non-relational databases with NoSQL and MongoDB

## Process
A starter notebook was provided which included basic imports and connecting to the browser. Further blocks provided guiding comments about what next steps need to be performed. I accessed numerous resources while going through the blocks. These resources included screenshots taken during lectures and demonstrations, solved activity files, and PyMongo documentation surroung different PyMongo functions.
